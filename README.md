`ark-sponge` is a Rust library that provides infrastructure for implementing 
*cryptographic sponges*. This library is released under the MIT License
and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review.
This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Overview

A cryptographic sponge is a cryptographic primitive that has two basic operations, *absorb* and *squeeze*. Sponges
accept byte or field element inputs through its absorb operation. At any time, sponges may output bytes or field
elements through its squeeze operation. Squeezed outputs are dependent on previous inputs and previous outputs.

The library offers infrastructure for building cryptographic sponges and using them with different types of inputs.
 
## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` toolchain of the Rust compiler. To install the latest version
of Rust, first install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via
your platform's package manager. Once `rustup` is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:
```bash
rustup install stable
```

After that, use `cargo` (the standard Rust build tool) to build the library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkworks-rs/sponge.git
cd sponge 
cargo build --release
```

This library comes with some unit and integration tests. Run these tests with:
```bash
cargo test
```

## License

 * [MIT License](LICENSE-MIT)

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution that you submit to this library shall be
